# Learning with the ArcGIS JavaScript API

I utilized the [ArcGIS QuickStart Guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/quick-start/) as a baseplate for how to use the API, but expanded from there on my own using my imagination and the API [docs](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/).

The data is my Google Maps location history, sourced as a JSON using Google's Takeout personal data extraction tool. It was then converted and cleaned as a CSV; huge thanks to [SQLify](https://sqlify.io) for allowing me to convert such a huge file. The file is hosted on AWS S3.
